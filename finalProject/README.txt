Assignment Instructions:

The goal of this project is to develop a basic data driven web application.

The theme of your project is up to you, but it must meet the following criteria:
  The application data must be stored in a SQLite database.
  The PDO library must be used to access the database.
  The application must have a login / logout mechanism for users.
  A user must be able to manipulate data in some fashion.
    (It does not necessarily need to use all CRUD operations depending on the theme of the application.)
  All data submitted via forms must be validated and appropriate error messages must be shown to the user if the data is not valid.
  Each page in of the web application must link to the same external CSS style sheet.
  The CSS style sheet must have at least ten rules and be named style.css.
  The server-side code must be modular.
    (That is, do not put all the code in a single file.)
  The web application must be sufficiently complex.
    (This criteria is somewhat subjective; if you think your idea for the web application is too simplistic, then ask me.)
  The home page of the web application must be named index.php.
