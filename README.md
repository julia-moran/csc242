Server-Side Web Development, Dr. Schwesinger, Fall 2022

This repository contains projects created for Server-Side Web Development, an elective I took in the Fall 2022 semester. Most of these projects are coded in PHP, with the exception of project 7, which was a project for practicing using SQLite statements. Projects 4, 5, 8, 9, and the final project combined the use of PHP, HTML, and CSS to produce web pages that can be found at https://csit.kutztown.edu/~jmora678/csc242. Links to the specific web pages can be found in the 
READMEs in the project folders. Projects 8, 9, and the final project utilized SQLite to store data needed in the web pages in databases.

The given instructions for each assignment can be found in the READMEs in each project folder.
